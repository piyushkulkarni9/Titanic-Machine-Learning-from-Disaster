This repo contains the dataset of passengers who were in the Titanic ship that sank on April 15, 1912, A.D. Out of 2224 passengers, 1502 were killed in the accident. The goal is to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic ship. 

Libraries Used
NumPy
Pandas
SciKit-Learn
SciPy
Matplotlib

Classifying algorithms used:
Logistic Regression
k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
Decision Tree
Random Forest

First, I trained these classifiers with training data. 
After that, using the trained classifier, predicted the survival outcome of test data.
Finally, calculated the accuracy score (in percentange) of the trained classifier.
